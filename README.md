# MFRC522
( Update - October 10, 2020 )
Added ASCII dump feature, use to dump all the card data.
Currently only works with MFRC522, I'll buy the new reader soon.
Hope that bank cards will work
Somebody suggested to use the 5V instead of 3V on MFRC522, I've conneced on UNO It didn't burn but didn't read the Mastercard either.
